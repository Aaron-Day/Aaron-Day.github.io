In the old days, they carried a sense of mystery and allure. Spice merchants would weave fantastic tales of danger to reach these spices in hopes of selling their wares at higher prices. In later centuries, the demand on spices became so great, that those who controlled the spices generated immense wealth and renown.

As leaders of competing nations, players must expand their domains, gain new technologies, and build wonders to rise above all others and shape the world to their own vision. By balancing their nation\u0027s pursuits, leaders can build a new society greater than any that has come before and guarantee that their people will not only survive, but thrive.\u003C/p\u003E\r\nLead Your People\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the start of each game, players draw a random leader card that they will embody for the duration of the game. Each leader comes with a unique focus bar setup to align with their nation\u2019s historical pursuits, as well as a special ability to give them an edge other players won\u0027t have. Each player also receives a set of cities, caravans, control tokens, diplomacy cards, focus cards, and a tech dial.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ENext, players will build the land they will set out to conquer with map tiles, populating it with barbarians, natural resources, and city-states. While advancing their nation\u2019s pursuits presents leaders with enough challenges, world events also occur periodically that affect the map and all of the players, such as barbarian attacks. Before each of the first player\u2019s turns, the first player advances the event dial, possibly producing one of these events.\u003C/p\u003E\r\nBuild Your Nation\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe leaders\u2019 goal is simple: to master this domain in order to become the leading world power. However, the exact method of their conquest changes with each game. These potential agendas are detailed on victory cards, three of which are set beside the map at the beginning of the game. Players race to complete one of the two agendas on each victory card. The first to accomplish this task wins the game.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPlayers complete the agendas given on victory cards by accomplishing tasks in five different focus areas: culture, science, economy, industry, and military. Players organize their focus areas by constructing a focus bar at the beginning of the game, which is placed beneath each player\u2019s leader card. A player\u2019s turn revolves around the focus row of five cards below his or her focus bar.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe focus row represents a nation\u2019s various pursuits. Each focus row has five slots, one for each type of card. The cards within the focus row shift to different slots as the player takes turns to represent a nation\u2019s investment of time in that particular project. A card resolved in the fifth slot has a greater impact than one resolved in the first slot, as more time was spent on that pursuit. Cards within the focus row generally shift toward the fifth slot until they are used, which is when it moves back to the first slot again. Over a series of turns, players use these cards to build their civilizations from single cities to sprawling empires filled with wonders and technology.\u003C/p\u003E\r\nDefine Your Civilization\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a wide array of choices, leaders must choose what type of civilization they will build. There are five types of focus cards that players can use to advance their civilizations, indicated by an icon in the upper-left corner. Each player\u2019s focus row contains one card of each type, starting with level \u201CI\u201D and advancing as their pursuits come to fruition. During the game, players can acquire advanced versions of their starting focus cards, which have greater impact on the game.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA leader may choose to create a peaceful civilization defined by artistic and intellectual pursuits. For artistic pursuits, the culture focus cards allow players to place control tokens, which can expand their territory and claim resources. The card\u2019s focus row slot also determines which types of terrain on which the player can place control tokens. For the intellectual, the science focus cards advance a player\u2019s tech dial, allowing the player to discover new technologies. The dial advances spaces equal to the number of the science card\u2019s focus row slot.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EConversely, a leader may choose a competitive civilization that uses rival nations to advance its own agendas. Economy focus cards allow a player to interact with city-states and rival cities by moving caravans. The card\u2019s focus row slot determines which terrain types the caravans can move into. The industry focus cards allow a player to build either a new city or a world wonder, which grants a powerful ability to the player who controls it. If building a city, the card\u2019s focus row slot determines which types of terrain the player can consider whereas, if the player is building a world wonder, the focus row slot contributes toward the cost of that wonder.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, a leader can build a militaristic civilization that rises to prominence by conquering any empires that stand in its way. Military focus cards allow a player to either reinforce defenses or perform attacks to defeat barbarians, conquer city-states, and capture rival territory. The focus row slot affects either how many control tokens can be reinforced, or affects the strength of each attack. Reinforced control tokens offer some protection against barbarians and other players by increasing its own combat value as well as those of each adjacent friendly city and control token. Otherwise, a player may choose to become a great military leader and battle rival cities, claiming an enemy\u2019s loot and world wonders for themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\r\nLeave Your Mark\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBy advancing their culture, science, economy, industry, and military, rulers can ensure their nation\u2019s survival through the ages. However, true leaders want their civilization to not only survive, but thrive by advancing their pursuits and completing agendas. To become the supreme world power, a player must complete at least one agenda on each victory card presented at the beginning of the game. At the start of the first player\u2019s turn, if a player has completed one agenda on each victory card, that player wins and ensures that their civilization will continue to flourish.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWill you conquer the world by spreading your influence, defeating enemy armies, or becoming the most technologically advanced nation in the world?

Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it\u0027s too late. Secret Hitler introduces new mechanics to the hidden-identity game genre. The first is the element of randomness. When laws are passed, the President draws three policies, passes two to the Chancellor, and the Chancellor enacts one. Only the enacted policy is revealed, so players have to rely on the President and Chancellor\u0027s word to know what got discarded. The deck has a known initial composition (11 Fascist policies, 6 Liberal policies), and players can roughly track deck contents based on what the President and Chancellor report, though someone might have lied about what was discarded. That means players can form reasonable expectations and plan around probability, but they can also manipulate future probabilities and expectations in a way that benefits their team. The second new mechanic is the \u0026quot;Hitler\u0026quot; identity: If Hitler is elected as Chancellor after the third fascist policy has already been enacted, the game ends immediately and the fascists win. This means Hitler will spend most of the game playing as a liberal to gain players\u0027 trust. Once the third fascist policy is enacted, anyone who has helped the group becomes immediately suspect; if the liberals make a wrong move at this point, they lose immediately. This creates incredible moments of tension and relief in the game.\u003C/p\u003E","ImageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/5cc.images/games/uploaded/1559257704919-51BpeBNTi-L.jpg","RulesUrl":"http://secrethitler.com/assets/Secret_Hitler_Rules.pdf","OfficialUrl":"http://secrethitler.com/?utm_source=boardgameatlas.com\u0026utm_medium=search\u0026utm_campaign=bga_ads","AverageRating":3.6263776509621755,"AverageLearningComplexity":2,"AverageStrategyComplexity":3,"Players":"5-10 Players","Playtime":"30-45 Minutes"},{"Mechanics":["Hand Management","Variable Player Powers"],"Categories":["Card Game","Comic Book / Strip","Cooperative","Fighting","Solo / Solitaire"],"MinPlayersBest":-1,"MaxPlayersBest":-1,"BggId":-1,"Upc":"","Expansions":[],"Id":"qhEsCymcPx","Name":"Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition","Handle":"sentinels-of-the-multiverse-definitive-edition","AtlasUrl":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/game/qhEsCymcPx/sentinels-of-the-multiverse-definitive-edition","YearPublished":2021,"MinPlayers":2,"MaxPlayers":5,"MinPlaytime":30,"MaxPlaytime":60,"MinAge":8,"PlayerCounts":[2,3,4,5],"Description":"\u003Cp\u003EIn \u003Cstrong\u003ESentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition\u003C/strong\u003E, all of the art is brand new.

You shuffle all 16 bonus tiles and place them face down next to the game board. The stand-up figure Mammoth herd is placed next to the pile. You are now ready to start the game. The game play stays the same except for the following changes.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the beginning of each round, the start player places the mammoth herd on the resource shown by the top-most bonus tile. For example, if the tile shows a brick, the start player puts the mammoth herd into the clay pit. Then, he/she picks the first bonus tile and places it face up next to the pile. (The resource that is now shown is of no importance in this round.) If there are no bonus tiles left, the whole herd is tamed. In this case, you remove the mammoth herd and continue playing according to the normal rules. You place your people as usual. Only in the phase in which you use the actions of your people figures, the mammoth herd becomes important. When you have people placed on the resource on which the mammoth herd stays, you roll the dice as usual and take your resources. Immediately after this, you may move one or more people from the resource where the mammoth herd is placed to the bonus tile that was turned over. With these people figures, you can try to tame a mammoth later in order to have help for your work. You are only allowed to move people figures from this resource production area, and you immediately have to pay 1 food for each people figure you place on the bonus tile. You may - as it is the case for feeding - substitute 1 food with 1 resource. People figures that are not placed on the bonus tile must be taken back to the player board. After all players have used the actions of their people, but before the feeding, you tame 1 mammoth from the mammoth herd.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAll players who moved people to the bonus tile roll the dice. Each player uses as many dice as he has people on the bonus tile. All players roll the dice at the same time. Now, you compare the score of your highest single die. (You do not add all dice together as usual, and you are not allowed to use tools.) The player with the highest single die score wins and takes the \u0026quot;1.\u0026quot; bonus. He may also, instead, take the \u0026quot;all\u0026quot; bonus. Then, the winner takes the tile and places it face down in front of himself. (The O on the back is not for the player. It just serves as a reminder for the final scoring). When the highest die scores are level, the players compare the next lower score, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf there is still a draw after comparing all results, all players involved get the \u0026quot;all\u0026quot; bonus.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe tile has to be put back into the box.

Dr. Doyle was an honest-to-goodness rocket scientist. He left NASA to design electronic games and toys, like Code Name: Sector and Electronic Battleship. He is perhaps best known for the groundbreaking Merlin, one of the first handheld electronic game systems, which featured multiple games in one device, variable difficulty levels, and the ability to save games-all in 1979! His influence can be seen today in the recent spate of games merging electronics and tabletop play. But the most fun of all his designs remains Stop Thief. \u003Cbr /\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\r\nThe obvious first step in our restoration was taking the electronic device and turning it into an app. Doing that allows us to get better sound quality and a more dynamic platform for different modes of play. Next step was ditching the roll and move mechanic and, in general, stripping out some of the luck and adding in a healthy dose of strategy. By replacing the dice for decks of movement cards, it also let us make the decks asymmetrical, which increases the fun and replayability. We also added game effects to the suspect cards to further spice things up. Finally, we gave the whole thing a fresh coat of paint with more current art and design.","ImageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/5cc.images/games/uploaded/1618166094564","RulesUrl":"https://restorationgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Stop-Thief-Co-op-Rules.pdf","OfficialUrl":"https://restorationgames.com/stopthief/?utm_source=boardgameatlas.com\u0026utm_medium=search\u0026utm_campaign=bga_ads","AverageRating":3.5299999999999994,"AverageLearningComplexity":0,"AverageStrategyComplexity":0,"Players":"1-4 Players","Playtime":"30-45 Minutes"},{"Mechanics":["Action Point Allowance System","Deck Building","Hand Management","Press Your Luck"],"Categories":["Card Game","Economic","Educational","Industry/Manufacturing","Math"],"MinPlayersBest":-1,"MaxPlayersBest":-1,"BggId":-1,"Upc":"","Expansions":[],"Id":"hQ9x9Wzu80","Name":"Subatomic: An Atom Building Game","Handle":"subatomic-an-atom-building-game","AtlasUrl":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/game/hQ9x9Wzu80/subatomic-an-atom-building-game","YearPublished":2018,"MinPlayers":2,"MaxPlayers":4,"MinPlaytime":40,"MaxPlaytime":60,"MinAge":10,"PlayerCounts":[2,3,4],"Description":"\u003Cp\u003ESubatomic is a deck-building game about building elements from subatomic particles!

At the end of the day, the boss who has the best combination of wit and bluff will become the most powerful tycoon in the Wild Wild West.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe game is played in a series of rounds. Each round, poker cards are dealt between the locations, which are laid out in a circle. Players place posse members on these location cards, which will both give an action and count as a bid for the location\u0027s valuable resources. Players also get a poker card of their own which uses the two adjacent cards from a location to form a three-card hand. This creates a clever mix of modern worker placement and poker that drives the game. In addition, players must manage their resources of Law, Money and Force to buy buildings and gunfight. If you have the highest stake in the most lucrative industry at the end, you will be rewarded bonus points. Add these points to the points you\u0027ve collected from buying buildings and determine the winner!
